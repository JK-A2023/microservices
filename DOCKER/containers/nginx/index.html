<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>As a teenager, Andrew founded an online gaming network, Complex Networks, with dedicated servers and payment facilitation for donating members. He then went on to complete a degree in International Business, Finance and Economics at Manchester. Following this, he worked as a Quantity Surveyor for about 18 months. He followed his passions in tech, and so switched to the Northcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp, and began his journey into DevOps. Throughout this switch, he developed skills in JavaScript, Python, PostgreSQL, Terraform, AWS, having the opportunity to apply these skills to his final Extract, Transform, Load platform project, transforming unsorted CSV data into query-able and consumable data. This led to him finding his real passion in DevOps; this holistic approach being both a cultural shift in development methodology, and an inter-departmental effort between development of infrastructure and automation, as well as emphasizing collaboration and integration between development and IT operation teams. In his free time, Andrew has been playing guitar and producing for 12 and 6 years respectively.</p>
