# Docker:

Docker is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that uses OS-level Virtualizsation to deliver software in packages called containers.
Docker is an open platform that separates applications from infrastructure, enabling rapid software delivery. It packages applications into isolated containers, streamlining deployment and reducing the gap between code and production.

## Benefits of Docker:

1. Faster Deployment: Build, test, and deploy apps within containers without worrying about target platform configurations. Share container images for easy execution.
2. Resource Efficiency: Lightweight containers use fewer resources than virtual machines, allowing multiple containers on a single host, optimizing resource sharing.
3. Scalability and Reliability: Easily scale apps by adding/removing containers. Docker ensures consistent performance across platforms.
4. Version Control and Reuse: Containers have built-in versioning and component reuse, simplifying tracking, updates, and rollbacks.

## Microservices Architecture:

In contrast to monolithic or 2-tier architectures, microservices break applications into independent services in containers. They communicate through APIs, enabling independent deployment and scaling, often aligned with DevOps for rapid adaptation to user requirements.
